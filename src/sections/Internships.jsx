            During my internship at <strong>Embrizon Technologies</strong>, I was introduced to the field of <strong>Data Science</strong>. I worked on real-time datasets, applied various preprocessing techniques, and developed machine learning models for predictive analytics. I gained hands-on experience with libraries like <strong>Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib</strong>, and improved my understanding of model evaluation, feature engineering, and data visualization.
          </p>
          <p className="subtext">
            I also contributed to a mini project that aimed to predict customer churn based on behavioral data. This experience helped me strengthen my foundation in Python and ML workflows.
